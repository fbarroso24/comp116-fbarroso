Assignment 5: Final Project

     For my final project, I decided to write a paper on privacy concerns on 
Android as it relates to music applications.  The final paper is titled:
"Privacy Concerns: Analysis of music applications on Android".  In addition, I
have also put together an 8 min video to provide as supporting material for my 
analysis.  The supporting material discusses potential problems as well as some 
workarounds and potential solutions.  I did not make it publicly available
since some of the screenshots show my username and personal information.
Instead I have uploaded it to github and made it privately available to 
mchow@cs.tufts.edu on youtube at the following URL: http://youtu.be/ldkX-KW9AH4
